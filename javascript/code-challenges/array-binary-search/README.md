# array-binary-search

  ```
    Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in
    2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.
    Without utilizing any of the built-in methods 
    available to your language, return the index of the
    arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the 
    search key, or -1 if the element is not in the 
    array.

    NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function
    should be a binary search.
